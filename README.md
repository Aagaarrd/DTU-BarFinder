Android app development project done as part of the course [02128 Software Project](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02128).

The app works as a compass pointing you to the primary attractions (in our opinion) of the Technical University of Denmark.

The app is available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.pressere.kbkompas).
